# Out-of-the-box, he dimensions (i.e axis) of the images were permutated* xyz -> zyx, and
# the orientations (AP/PA, LR/RL, etc.) were also mixed up. Thusly, SPM was loading a
# shuffled version of the 3D array in memory, leading to exceptions in their linear algebra
# (singular operators, etc.).
#
# Fix is to run fslwapdim followed by fslorient -deleteorient.
#
# * This goes beyond the information coded by just the affine. This has to do with the
# [sq]form.
